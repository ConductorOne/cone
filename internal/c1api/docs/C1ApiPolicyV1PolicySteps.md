NewC1ApiPolicyV1PolicySteps instantiates a new C1ApiPolicyV1PolicySteps object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewC1ApiPolicyV1PolicyStepsWithDefaults

`func NewC1ApiPolicyV1PolicyStepsWithDefaults() *C1ApiPolicyV1PolicySteps`

NewC1ApiPolicyV1PolicyStepsWithDefaults instantiates a new C1ApiPolicyV1PolicySteps object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set
